## Virtual Keyword

``` 
Struct Animal{
    void Name(){
        cout << "Animal\n"
    }
}

Struct Monkey: public Animal{
    void Name(){
        cout << "Monkey\n";
    }   
}

void typeofa(Animal &animal){
    animal.Name();
}

int main(){
    Monkey m;
    typeofa(a)
}   

```
- The virtual keyword will make it to where when typeofa is called, it simply prints "animal" instead of monkey. Now, if in the monkey class we declared void Name with "virtual" it would actually print "Monkey"

## Primitives
- Arrays: string s[], string[] s - BOTH of these work
- Structs are stack based values
    - Allocated on the stack
- Classes are heap based
    - Allocate a class using the "new" operator
    - There is no delete
    - Uses garbage collector
- Dont use pointers
