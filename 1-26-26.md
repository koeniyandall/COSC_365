# Classification, Very Abridged Hisotry, and Covered Languages

## Declaritive
- These kinds of languages are older.
- Functional
    - Functional languages use a computational model of recursive definition of functions
    - That is, functions act like mathematical functions
    - Tends to lead to much simpler, but many more functions


## Imperitive
- Changing a mutating state
    - i = i + 1
- Imperitive languages tell the machine how to run
- Think things like C, python, C++ - pretty much anything weve learned so far

### Fortran
- made for IBM in 1957
- had high level language concepts

### C#
- Attributes
    - compiled
    - object-orientated
    - (.NET)
    - imperitive
- Emphasizes rapid and large-scale development
- C# is fully portable now
    - MSFT supports Mac and Linux via "dotnet"
    - Third-party mon

### Haskell
- Attributes
    - purely functional
    - compiled
- Emphasizes reliability and bug reduction at time of writing code

### Rust
- Attributes
    - compiled (has and interpreted option)
    - blended: either imperitive or declaritive
- Emphasizes safety
